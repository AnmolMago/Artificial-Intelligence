# Artificial Intelligence
Exploring the field of AI
### Pacman
Build, apply and compare simple search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*) to efficiently collect food on the way to a target location. This project explores finding good heuristics and effectively implementing suboptimal search.

This project is created by UC Berkeley's AI division and can be found [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa10/projects/search/search.html).
