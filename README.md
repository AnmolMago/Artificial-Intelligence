Exploring the field of AI
### Isolation

Build an adversarial game playing agent by implementing techniques such as Iterative Deepening and Alpha Beta pruning.

### Pacman

Build, apply and compare search algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS, A\*) to efficiently collect food on the way to a target location. This project explores finding good heuristics and effectively implementing suboptimal search.

This project is created by UC Berkeley's AI division and can be found [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa10/projects/search/search.html).

### Simulated Annealing

Apply Simulated Annealing to solve the travelling salesman problem.

### Sudoku
